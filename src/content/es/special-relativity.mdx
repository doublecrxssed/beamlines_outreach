# Special Relativity

Imagine you are standing on a train platform, and a super-fast express train zooms past you. If you could somehow see the clock inside the train, and measure the train itself while it was moving, what would you see?

Before Albert Einstein, physicists believed that space and time were absolute. A clock ticks at the same speed everywhere, and a one-meter stick is always one meter long. 

But Einstein realized something horrifying: **The speed of light is the only absolute thing in the universe.** No matter how fast you are moving, light always travels at exactly 299,792,458 meters per second ($c$). 

Because the speed of light cannot change, something else *must* change. When objects move very fast (close to $c$), **Space** squishes and **Time** slows down! 

### The Relativistic Railway

We are going to simulate a train platform where the train can travel up to 99% the speed of light. Both you (standing on the platform) and a passenger (sitting on the train) have identical stopwatches.

**Your Goal:** Observe how extreme velocity distorts reality.
*   **Step 1:** Look at the two stopwatches ticking at normal speed (`0.0c`). They are synchronized.
*   **Step 2:** Push the **Velocity Throttle** up to exactly `0.5c` (half the speed of light). What happens to the train's clock? What happens to the train's shape?
*   **Step 3:** Push the throttle to `0.99c`. Notice how the train squishes into a pancake, and the clock almost stops! This is called **Length Contraction** and **Time Dilation**.
*   **Step 4:** Now, click the **"View from Train"** button. Suddenly, the train passenger thinks *they* are stationary, and the *platform* is zooming backward! Whose clock is ticking slower now?

<MathGate buttonText="Reveal the Lorentz Factor">
  The amount of distortion is determined by the Lorentz Factor, denoted by $\gamma$ (gamma): $\gamma = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 - \frac{v^2}{c^2}}}$. As velocity ($v$) approaches the speed of light ($c$), $\gamma$ approaches infinity. Time for the moving observer is calculated as $t' = \frac{t}{\gamma}$, meaning it gets vastly smaller (time slows down).

### Checkpoint

Let's test what you just experienced on the railway.

<CheckpointQuiz 
  question="You are standing on a platform, watching a train zoom by at 99% the speed of light. Compared to your watch, what happens to a clock inside the train?"
  options='[{"text":"It ticks much faster than your watch.","isCorrect":false},{"text":"It ticks at the exact same speed as your watch.","isCorrect":false},{"text":"It ticks much slower than your watch.","isCorrect":true},{"text":"It runs backward.","isCorrect":false}]'
  explanation="Correct! This is Time Dilation. From the perspective of a stationary observer, time moves significantly slower for an object traveling close to the speed of light."
