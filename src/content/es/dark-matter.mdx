# The Invisible Universe

When you look up at the night sky, you see millions of stars. If you look through a powerful telescope, you can see entire galaxies, like our Milky Way, spinning slowly in the vastness of space.

But in the 1970s, an astronomer named **Vera Rubin** noticed something impossible. She was measuring how fast stars on the outer edges of galaxies were spinning around the center.

### The Fast Merry-Go-Round

Imagine you are on a playground merry-go-round (चरखी/झूला). If your friends spin it slowly, it's easy to hold on. If they spin it *extremely* fast, the centrifugal force will throw you off unless you are tied down with a strong rope!

Galaxies work the same way. Gravity acts like the "rope" holding stars in orbit. The problem was that Vera Rubin found the outer stars were spinning *waaaaay* too fast. According to the laws of physics, there was not enough "visible" matter (stars, planets, gas) to create enough gravity to hold them. The galaxies should have ripped apart and thrown the stars into deep space!

Since the galaxies *were not* ripping apart, there had to be some huge, invisible source of gravity acting as a super-strong rope. Astronomers called this mysterious substance **Dark Matter**.

We cannot see it, we cannot touch it, and it does not interact with light. But we know it exists because of its immense gravitational pull. In fact, **85% of all the matter in the universe is Dark Matter**!

### The Gravity Carousel

Try Vera Rubin's experiment yourself. Below is a simulation of a spinning galaxy.

**Step 1:** Increase the Rotation Speed slider and observe what happens to the stars on the edge when there is no Dark Matter.
**Step 2:** Click the "Inject Dark Matter Halo" button to add invisible gravity to the galaxy.
**Step 3:** Try increasing the rotation speed again!

<MathGate buttonText="Reveal the Equation">
  The orbital velocity of a star at radius $R$ from the galactic center is given by $v = \sqrt{GM(R)/R}$, where $M(R)$ is the mass enclosed within radius $R$. Vera Rubin observed that $v$ remains mostly constant even at large radii, implying $M(R)$ must increase linearly with $R$. This missing, non-luminous mass is Dark Matter!

### Checkpoint

Let's verify what you just observed.

<CheckpointQuiz 
  question="Why did astronomers like Vera Rubin conclude that Dark Matter must exist?"
  options='[{"text":"Because they saw it glowing faintly through large telescopes.","isCorrect":false},{"text":"Because outer stars in galaxies were orbiting so fast that visible gravity alone could not hold them in.","isCorrect":true},{"text":"Because it blocks the light from other stars like a dark cloud.","isCorrect":false},{"text":"Because black holes are dark and massive.","isCorrect":false}]'
  explanation="Exactly! The galaxies were spinning too rapidly to stay together based purely on the gravity generated by visible stars. The mathematical existence of a massive, invisible glue—Dark Matter—was the only way to explain why the galaxies did not rip apart!"
