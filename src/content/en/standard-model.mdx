# The Standard Model

Welcome to the fundamental building blocks of the universe. If you were to take a piece of matter—like an apple—and cut it in half over and over again, eventually, you would reach a point where it can no longer be divided. 

These indivisible pieces are called **elementary particles**. For a long time, scientists thought atoms were the smallest things in the universe. But inside the atom, there are protons and neutrons, and inside *them*, there are even smaller building blocks.

The "Standard Model" is the scientific recipe book that lists every single fundamental ingredient used to cook up the universe. There are two main categories:
1. **Fermions (Matter Particles):** These make up everything you can touch. Examples include Quarks and Electrons.
2. **Bosons (Force Carriers):** These don't make up matter; they communicate forces between matter. For example, Photons are Bosons that carry the electromagnetic force (light).

Let's see if you can organize the universe.

### The Particle Sorter

Below is a chaotic jumble of fundamental particles. Your goal is to sort them into their correct categories.

*   **Step 1:** Tap any particle (like $u$ or $\gamma$) to scan it. The scanner will reveal a clue about its physical properties.
*   **Step 2:** Read the rules posted on the three target Jars (Quarks, Leptons, Bosons). 
*   **Step 3:** Use the clue to logically deduce which jar the particle belongs to, and drag it there!

Try to successfully deduce and sort all the particles!

<MathGate buttonText="Reveal the Equation">
  The Lagrangian of the Standard Model mathematical formula is incredibly complex, but it unifies three of the four fundamental forces: electromagnetic, weak, and strong nuclear interactions. It is the most rigorously tested theory in all of physics.

### Checkpoint

Now that you've sorted the particles, let's verify what you've learned.

<CheckpointQuiz 
  question="Which of the following particles is considered a 'Force Carrier' (a Boson) rather than a piece of solid matter?"
  options='[{"text":"Up Quark","isCorrect":false},{"text":"Electron","isCorrect":false},{"text":"Photon","isCorrect":true},{"text":"Neutrino","isCorrect":false}]'
  explanation="Photons are Bosons that carry the electromagnetic force (light). Quarks, Electrons, and Neutrinos are all Fermions, which make up solid matter."
